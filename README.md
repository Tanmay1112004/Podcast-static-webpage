To make sure your website is responsive and fits well on all devices (like mobile, tablet, and desktop), you can follow these guidelines and modifications:

### Steps to Ensure Responsiveness:

1. **Viewport Meta Tag**: Add the viewport meta tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML to ensure the website is scaled correctly on mobile devices.

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
   ```

2. **Bootstrap Grid System**: Use Bootstrap's grid system to make your layout responsive. This will allow the content to stack vertically on smaller screens.

3. **Responsive Images**: Ensure that images are responsive by using the `img-fluid` class from Bootstrap, which scales images nicely to the parent element.

   ```html
   <img src="image-source.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
   ```

4. **Use `container` classes**: To ensure that your content is properly aligned and has appropriate margins, wrap your sections within Bootstrap's `.container` or `.container-fluid` classes.

   ```html
   <div class="container">
       <!-- Your content here -->
   </div>
   ```

5. **Test Across Devices**: Use Chrome DevTools or any browser's developer tools to simulate different device screens and ensure that your website is displaying correctly.

### Code Modifications for Responsiveness

- **Add the Viewport Meta Tag** in the `<head>` section:
  ```html
  <head>
      <!-- Existing code -->
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
      <!-- Existing code -->
  </head>
  ```

- **Wrap sections in a Bootstrap `container`** for consistent padding and alignment:
  ```html
  <div class="container">
      <div id="sectionBookStoreHomePage">
          <!-- Existing content -->
      </div>
  </div>
  ```

- **Use `img-fluid` for images** to ensure they scale correctly:
  ```html
  <img src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/book-apj-img.png" class="img-fluid" alt="APJ Abdul Kalam image">
  ```
